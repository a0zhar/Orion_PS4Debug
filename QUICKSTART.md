# Quickstart Guide
**If you're not looking to modify the source code of PS4Debug and just want to use it, here's a simple step-by-step guide:**

1. **Download PS4Cheater**  
   Get the latest version of PS4Cheater from [this link](https://github.com/ctn123/PS4_Cheater/releases/download/1.5.4.7/PS4_Cheater_v1.5.4.7_rev2_x64.rar).
2. **Download PS4Debug**  
   Download the latest version of the `ps4debug.bin` file from one of the following sources:  
   - This repository’s [Releases page](https://github.com/a0zhar/PS4_Debug/releases/)  
   - [CTN123's Release Page](https://github.com/ctn123/PS4_Cheater/releases/download/1.5.4.7/ps4debug.bin)
3. **Visit an Exploit Host**  
   Choose an exploit host and run a Homebrew Enabler. I recommend one of the following:
   - [Karo218](https://Kar0218.github.io/)
   - [GamerHack](https://gamerhack.github.io)
4. **Run the Bin Loader Payload**  
   **(Avoid using the one from GOLDHEN)**.  
   After running the Bin Loader, your PS4 should show a system notification with a code—either 9021 or 9020.
5. **Configure PS4Cheater**  
   On your PC, open PS4Cheater and enter:
   - Your PS4’s **IP Address**
   - The **Port number** displayed in the notification after loading the Bin Loader.
6. **Confirm Connection**  
   If successful, PS4Cheater will display **"PS4Debug.bin Successfully Injected!"**.
7. **Start the Game**  
   Launch your favorite game on the PS4.
8. **Attach to the Process**  
   Attach PS4Cheater to the game or userland process you want to debug.
9. **Enjoy the Debugging**  
   You’re now set to enjoy remote debugging and more!
