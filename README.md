# PS4Debug
### Originally Created by **golden**
PS4Debug is a payload-based debugger for the PS4, written in C. It is a critical tool for enabling applications like **PS4Cheater** to perform remote debugging operations on a PS4 system via a PC.

Currently, the debugger operates in **User-Mode**, as kernel-mode debugging is not supported yet. However, there are plans to explore and implement kernel-mode functionality in the future.

## Support
This fork of PS4Debug supports PS4 system firmware: 5.05, 6.72, and 7.00 to 11.00.

## Features

The debugger offers several powerful features for managing processes, memory, and threads on the PS4. 
Below is a breakdown of its capabilities:
- Add, remove, and manage both software and hardware breakpoints.  
- Monitor specific memory addresses for read or write access using watchpoints.  
- Pause the execution of a process (freezing the game on the screen).  
- Resume a paused process.  
- Terminate a process by forcefully ending its execution.  
- Execute instructions one at a time after a breakpoint is hit (single-step execution), allowing for detailed analysis of program behavior.  
- Read memory from a process, enabling access to data stored in the process's memory.  
- Write memory to a process, modifying values stored in the process's memory.  
- View the memory layout of a process and inspect its memory regions and protections.  
- Retrieve metadata of running processes, such as process IDs (PIDs), names, paths, and other relevant details.  
- Pause individual threads within a process.  
- Resume paused threads.  
- Inspect thread details, including their state and register values.  
- Access and control CPU debug registers, enabling advanced breakpoint and watchpoint handling.
