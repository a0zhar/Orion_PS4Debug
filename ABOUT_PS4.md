# About PS4 and it's Operating System
The PlayStation 4 (PS4) console operates on Orbis OS, a custom operating system derived from FreeBSD 9.0, tailored specifically for gaming and multimedia performance. 
FreeBSD, known for its robustness and scalability, provides a Unix-like foundation for Orbis OS, with extensive modifications to optimize for the PS4’s hardware architecture and gaming requirements.

Orbis OS runs on an x86-64 architecture designed to exploit the capabilities of the PS4’s AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU), which integrates CPU and GPU functionalities. 
Its kernel, built for high efficiency and low latency, underpins the gaming experience by managing critical resources and ensuring stability.

## Quick Description of the Operating System's Features:

### Process Management:
Orbis OS implements a comprehensive approach to process management, inheriting and enhancing features from FreeBSD:
- Process Lifecycle and States:
  - Processes progress through typical states: new, ready, running, waiting, and terminated.
  - The system handles state transitions based on events such as I/O operations, scheduling, or termination requests.
- Process Creation and Hierarchy:
  - Processes are created via fork or similar system calls, duplicating a parent process. The newly created process (child) receives a unique Process Identifier (PID), maintaining a hierarchical relationship with the parent.
- Multithreading:
  - Threads within a process share memory and resources, facilitating efficient multitasking. Orbis OS supports kernel-level threading, allowing multiple threads to execute independently while sharing the process’s address space.
- Scheduling:
  - Orbis OS employs preemptive multitasking with priority-based scheduling, ensuring that time-critical gaming processes or threads receive the CPU time they need for responsiveness.

### Memory Management:
The memory subsystem in Orbis OS provides robust features for secure and efficient memory allocation:
- Virtual Memory:
  - Each process operates in its isolated virtual address space, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access to other processes’ memory.
- Paging and Protection:
  - The OS uses paging mechanisms to map virtual memory to physical memory dynamically. It implements memory protection, marking regions as read-only, executable, or non-accessible as needed.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation:
  - Processes manage their heap (for dynamically allocated objects) and stack (for function calls and local variables). The kernel provides APIs for allocating and freeing memory as required.
- Memory Segmentation:
  - Process memory is divided into distinct segments:
    - Text: Stores the executable code.
    - Data: Holds global and static variables.
    - Heap: Used for dynamic allocation.
    - Stack: Grows/shrinks with function calls.

### File Systems
Orbis OS inherits FreeBSD's robust filesystem architecture, optimized for gaming:
- File Descriptors:
  - Processes interact with files and devices through file descriptors, abstract identifiers provided by the kernel.
- Shared Memory and Memory-Mapped Files:
  - Shared memory allows multiple processes to access common data regions efficiently.
  - Memory-mapped files enable direct access to file contents in memory, reducing I/O overhead.
- Executable File Formats:
  - Orbis OS supports the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) for its executables and libraries. Debuggers and other tools interact with ELF headers for process inspection and manipulation.

### Interprocess Communication (IPC)
IPC mechanisms in Orbis OS facilitate coordination and data sharing between processes:
- Shared Memory and Pipes:
  - Processes can share data using shared memory segments or communicate via pipes for stream-based data transfer.
- Message Queues:
  - These allow structured data exchange between processes.
- Synchronization:
  - Orbis OS offers semaphores and mutexes to ensure consistent access to shared resources, preventing race conditions in multithreaded applications.

### System Calls
System calls form the interface between user-space applications and the Orbis OS kernel:
- Implementation and Tracing:
  - Debuggers utilize system calls to manipulate process states, memory, and I/O. System call tracing allows developers to inspect syscall usage in applications.
- Common System Calls:
  - Calls like ptrace (for process inspection), mmap (memory mapping), and kill (sending signals to processes) are integral to debugging operations.
