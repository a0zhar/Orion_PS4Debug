# About Processes on the PS4
The PlayStation 4 (PS4) runs on **Orbis OS**, a heavily customized version of FreeBSD 9.0.

### **Process Management in Orbis OS**
Orbis OS, like FreeBSD, uses a hierarchical model to manage processes. Each process is uniquely identified by a **Process Identifier (PID)** and organized into parent-child relationships.

#### Key Features:
1. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Processes can be in states such as new, ready, running, waiting, or terminated.
   - Operations like fork or execve spawn new processes, often used for loading new games or applications.

2. **Multithreading**:
   - Processes can have multiple threads sharing the same address space. Threads are lightweight and managed via kernel-level threading APIs.
   - This is particularly useful for games that rely on concurrency for rendering, physics, and networking.

3. **Scheduling**:
   - Orbis OS employs a **preemptive, priority-based scheduling system** to ensure critical tasks (e.g., rendering) get priority.
   - Real-time priorities are granted to time-sensitive operations, which is essential for maintaining smooth gameplay.

4. **Signals**:
   - Processes use signals for communication, similar to FreeBSD. Debuggers leverage these signals (e.g., `SIGTRAP`) to manage breakpoints and other debugging tasks.

### **Process Memory Layout**
Each process in Orbis OS has its own **virtual address space**, isolating it from other processes for security and stability. This layout is inspired by FreeBSD’s virtual memory model but optimized for PS4’s hardware.

#### Memory Segments:
1. **Text Segment**:
   - Contains executable code (game logic, system libraries).
   - Marked as read-only and executable to prevent unauthorized modification.

2. **Data Segment**:
   - Stores global and static variables.
   - Split into initialized and uninitialized data segments (e.g., `.data` and `.bss`).

3. **Heap**:
   - Dynamically allocated memory for runtime needs (e.g., game objects).
   - Grows upward and is managed by system calls like `mmap` or `brk`.

4. **Stack**:
   - Used for local variables and function call management.
   - Grows downward with automatic protections to prevent overflows.

5. **Memory-Mapped I/O**:
   - Some regions are mapped to GPU memory or hardware registers for high-speed data exchange.

### **Memory Protections**
Memory protection is critical in Orbis OS for preventing unauthorized memory access:
- **Paging**: Virtual memory pages are mapped to physical memory. Pages have access rights (read, write, execute).
- **ASLR** (Address Space Layout Randomization):
  - Introduced in later firmware versions for userland processes.
  - Ensures that process memory layouts (e.g., stack, heap, shared libraries) are randomized, thwarting certain types of exploits.
  - Kernel ASLR is not implemented in early firmware versions but affects userland exploit strategies.

### **Debugging Infrastructure**
Debugging processes in Orbis OS involves manipulating process states, reading memory, and setting breakpoints.

#### Debug Registers:
- The PS4 provides **x86-64 debug registers** (DR0-DR7), allowing precise breakpoints on memory addresses or instructions.
- **Hardware breakpoints** leverage these registers for efficient and minimally intrusive debugging.

#### Memory Access:
- Debuggers interact with process memory through `ptrace`-like system calls.
- Typical operations include:
  - **Read/Write Memory**: Access process memory directly.
  - **Set Breakpoints**: Replace instructions with traps.
  - **Get/Set Registers**: Inspect or modify CPU registers for threads.

### **Custom System Calls**
Orbis OS extends FreeBSD’s syscall interface with custom APIs for managing game processes:
- **SYS_PROC_VM_MAP**: Enumerates memory regions, returning detailed information about virtual memory mappings.
- **SYS_PROC_RW**: Reads or writes memory in a specific process.

These calls are essential for implementing cheat-engine-like functionalities, such as memory scanning and value modification.
